    <h1>Meanwood Kwamwena Community Hub</h1>
    
    <p><strong><em>By residents, for residents</em></strong></p>

    <h2>Welcome to Meanwood Kwamwena Community Hub</h2>
    
    <p>We are excited to introduce the Meanwood Kwamwena Community Hub, a digital platform created by and for our community. What started as a simple idea over conversations with neighbours has grown into something we believe can truly transform how we connect, share information, and support each other.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    
    <p>Meanwood Kwamwena Community Hub aims to be your one-stop information centre for news, events, announcements, business listings, clubs, societies, and so much more.</p>

    <h2>Starting Simple, Dreaming Big</h2>
    
    <p>We are initially launching as a landing page (single-page static website), but we have ambitious plans. Here is what we envision growing into over time:</p>

    <h3>Initial Phase (first three months)</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Website</strong>: Have a landing page (static website) that welcomes people to this new initiative, to get the word out there, so to speak.</li>
        <li><strong>Facebook Page</strong>: A Facebook page to support the website</li>
        <li><strong>Facebook Group</strong>: A Facebook group as a simple way to get members from the community</li>
        <li><strong>LinkedIn Page</strong>: A LinkedIn page to support the website</li>
        <li><strong>WhatsApp Group</strong>: A WhatsApp group as a simple way to get members from the community</li>
        <li><strong>Internal Organisation System</strong>: This involves outlining a mechanism by which the community hub can keep organised. This includes storage of drafts, archiving information, sequence of steps required to do something (instructions), onboarding system, content strategy, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Immediate Priorities (next 3 to 6 months)</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blog</strong>: Get the latest news updates about Meanwood Kwamwena. This includes a real-time daily live blog feed, general information about the area, and much more.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Notice Board</strong>: A digital notice board for broadcasting announcements from key community stakeholders like the Local Municipal Council, public service providers, schools, clinic, churches, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Events Calendar</strong>: A digital calendar for community members to know key dates and venues for events within the Meanwood Kwamwena area.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Business Directory</strong>: Listings of businesses located within and around the Meanwood Kwamwena area. Listings will include trading hours, work days, contact information, services, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Price Check Tool</strong>: A snapshot of the current prices of goods and services within the local markets and shops.</li>
        <li><strong>Volunteers</strong>: Get as many volunteers as possible who can contribute via information gathering, information verification, storytelling, content creation, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Fundraising</strong>: To set up a monetisation system that sustains the community hub. This includes selling advertising space on our online platforms, getting sponsorship from well-wishers, investors, corporate supporters, etc.; receiving donations from the greater Meanwood Kwamwena community; and a reward mechanism for would-be supporters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mid-term Priorities (6 to 12 months)</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clubs and Societies Registry</strong>: Creation of a registry of all the clubs and societies within the community. This includes information on how to register and become a member, meeting days, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Contributor Network</strong>: To evolve the list of volunteers into a robust contributor network system, where residents can sign up, with a leaderboard ranking, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>YouTube Video Channel</strong>: As our content matures, we hope to offer videos as an alternative source of information.</li>
        <li><strong>State of Roads Bulletin</strong>: An important part of the community for road users to assist in the prevention of road incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Future Innovations (12+ months)</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Marketplace</strong>: A marketplace platform for community members to buy and sell goods and services within the community. In addition, service exchanges and tool and equipment rental systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliable Maps</strong>: Up-to-date and accurate maps of the Meanwood Kwamwena area, including accurate bus routes, business locations, navigation, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Emergency Systems</strong>: These include accurate information on emergency contacts like Fire, Ambulance, and Police; power outage tracking systems; flood alert systems; and fire alert systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Radio Station</strong>: As our content provision matures, we hope to offer live radio as a real-time source of information. This will help include non-internet users of the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Crime Watch System</strong>: A feed containing key information related to crime, like wanted lists, location-based crime hot zones, crime statistics, etc.</li>
    </ul>
